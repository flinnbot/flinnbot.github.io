To revoke consent to the use of your PII and to have your PII removed from the Company’s database, contact the Company using the Contact Information listed at the end of this Privacy Policy and your account and profile will be deleted.

This Privacy Policy applies only to our Software. It does not apply to any third party site or service linked to our Software or recommended or referred by our Software.

__2.  Non-Personally-Identifiable Information (Non-PII)__ 

The Company may use analytic and reporting technologies to collect anonymous information from you about your patterns of use or other statistical patterns. Examples of this anonymous information are: your browser type, your device’s operating system, date/time of access to the Software, geographic information, browser history, and device type. This is not an exhaustive list of the types of Non-PII we may collect; it merely provides examples of the kinds of data we may collect.

__3.  Method of Collection__

*a. Collection of PII*

The Company collects your information, including PII, when you create an account with us.

*b. Collection of Passive Non-PII*

The Company may collect passive non-PII by using browser cookies and other analytic and reporting technologies. This collection of non-PII may be done passively (i.e., without your affirmative consent) while you are using our Software.

*i. Browser Cookies*

A browser cookie is a small file usually used to persist data between browser sessions by saving certain pieces of Non-PII. It allows the browser to “remember” what you did the last time you visited a particular site. They can also be used to create long-term records of your browsing history.

The Company may use browser cookies for the purposes of providing you with a better user experience by remembering information from your previous sessions and for analyzing user traffic, trends, and other useful statistical information. This cookie information may be passed to third parties if required by law.

You can delete these cookies or, by using a setting in your browser, disable the use of cookies altogether but your experience with our Software will not be as robust.

The Company shall not use browser cookies to collect PII.

*ii. Other Analytic and Reporting Technologies*

The Company may also use other analytic and reporting technologies to better understand how you and other users use our Software, to improve our services, to optimize your experience, and to do other statistical analysis of our Software users.

The Company shall not use any of these analytic and reporting technologies to collect PII.

__4.  Storage of Your Information__

The Company stores the information it collects in servers owned by a reputable cloud provider. Your use of our Software acts as your consent to transfer your PII outside of your country of residence if such servers reside outside of your country of residence.

__5.  Use of Your Information__

The Company does not sell, rent, or share your PII.

You have consented to the Company’s use of your non-PII by your use and download our Software. The Company reserves the right to make full use of your non-PII. The Company may use your non-PII in any of the following ways:

The Company may use your non-PII for the purposes of demographics and analytics. The Company may use your non-PII for the purpose of analyzing traffic to our Software. This use may include those to provide better service to users of our Software, to customize our Software based on your preferences, to compile and analyze statistics about our Software.

- The Company may use your non-PII to analyze trends and statistics on our Software.
- The Company may use your non-PII to assist the Company in our operation, evaluation, and improvement of our Software or our services in general.
- The Company may use your non-PII if necessary for compliance with applicable legal requirements, industry standards, or Company policies.


The Company may use your PII to send you push notifications.

The Company shall not link your PII with your non-PII in a way that would serve to identify your behaviors on a personal level. As an example, the Company will not keep a record of how many times you have personally used our Software. Instead, the Company may conglomerate your usage statistics with those of others to look for trends.

The Company abides by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2701-2711 (“ECPA”). All email messages and other electronic communications sent through our Software and only viewable to those to whom they are sent are considered as confidential and private except as required by law, including without limitation, the ECPA. Our Software is not considered a “secured communications medium” under the ECPA. We have a limited ability to intercept and/or disclose electronic messages. Some of the situations under which we are allowed to intercept and disclose electronic messages is when we receive a court order, subpoena, warrant, or other legal demand and when we receive information that appears to be related to a criminal act.

__6.  Protection of PII__

The Company uses reasonable practices and technologies to safeguard your information against illegal intrusion and unauthorized access; however, no security measures are 100% reliable. Therefore, the Company cannot warranty the security of your PII.

The Company does not guarantee that your PII will never be compromised because no electronic transmission is completely secure. Even though the Company will employ every reasonable security measure to protect the privacy of your PII, the Company cannot guarantee that these security measures will be sufficient or that they will never fail or be circumvented. 

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE USING OUR SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND UNDERSTAND THAT INFORMATION YOU SHARE THROUGH OUR SOFTWARE IS SHARED AT YOUR OWN RISK.

__7.  Access to PII__

*a.  Service Providers*

The Company may disclose your PII to service providers including, but not limited to, our IT personnel who maintain our Software. These trusted service providers will have access to your PII but may not use your PII for any purposes other than those to which they have been entrusted. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that these service providers hold your PII in confidence. In addition, the Company shall only disclose your PII to third parties that the Company believes in good faith follow acceptable privacy and security policies.

*b.  Legal Enforcement*

The Company may disclose your PII to investigate or enforce violations of our rights. The Company may also disclose your PII to protect the security of our Software. In addition, the Company reserves the right to disclose your PII if the Company has a good faith belief that this disclosure is necessary to satisfy a legal process or enforceable governmental request (such as a subpoena) or to be in compliance with any law or regulation.

*c.  Successors*

The Company may transfer your PII as part of a sale, merger, acquisition, or any other change of control. In addition, the Company reserves the right to transfer your PII to protect the Company’s legal rights in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, assignment, or any application of creditors’ rights.
